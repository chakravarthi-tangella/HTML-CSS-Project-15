# Product Design Landing Page | Project-15 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technologies-HTML--CSS-blue)

Hi, I'm **`Chakravarthi Tangella`**. This is my fifteenth project in my Full Stack web developer Course. I used HTML and pure CSS for this project.

I used media queries to make this design responsive. Now, I am confident that I can make any page without using any CSS frameworks.
